## BENEFITS SECTION

### Section Headline
**Why Developers Choose HexaHub**

### Benefit 1: Real Privacy, Not Corporate Policy
Your code, data, and workflows remain on your hardware. No one reads your prompts. No one trains on your queries. Privacy isn't a checkbox—it's the foundation.

**Subheadline:** Keep your intellectual property where it belongs—under your roof.

### Benefit 2: True Control & No Vendor Surprises
No sudden price hikes. No API deprecations that break your systems. No TOS changes that affect your workflow. When you host it yourself, you own the future of your automation stack.

**Subheadline:** Change providers, modify agents, evolve your infrastructure—on your terms.

### Benefit 3: Better Economics at Scale
Self-hosting costs less than enterprise SaaS once you scale. No per-seat licensing. No margin markups. Just infrastructure costs and your time—and both decrease as you optimize.

**Subheadline:** Invest in infrastructure you control, not vendor relationships you tolerate.

## SECONDARY MESSAGING (For Expanded Copy / FAQ Section)

### Why Now?
AI is becoming essential to modern development. But building on closed platforms creates risks: vendor dependency, data exposure, cost unpredictability. Self-hosted AI isn't the future—it's the responsible choice for serious teams.

### The HexaHub Difference
We're not trying to be a cheaper version of vendor AI platforms. We're building for developers who refuse to outsource control. That means:

- **Transparency over features** - You see exactly what runs where
- **Flexibility over convenience** - Swap components, optimize freely
- **Sustainability over venture VC timelines** - Built to outlast trends
- **Community over corporate** - Governed by users, not investors

### Common Use Cases
1. **Code Review Automation** - AI agents review PRs against your standards
2. **Documentation Generation** - Auto-generate from codebases, keep it internal
3. **Deployment Automation** - Intelligent release workflows with safe rollback
4. **Team Productivity** - Custom chatbots trained on internal knowledge
5. **Security & Compliance** - Automated policy enforcement, audit logging
6. **Research & Experimentation** - Prototype with latest models, no API costs
