# HexaHub Brand Guidelines

## Voice & Tone

**Overall Voice:** Professional but approachable - We speak developer-to-developer

**Tone Principles:**
1. **Direct & Clear:** No fluff, get to the point (developers hate marketing speak)
2. **Technically Accurate:** Assume technical knowledge, don't dumb down
3. **Privacy-Conscious:** Always emphasize data sovereignty and trust
4. **Community-Driven:** Open-source values, collaborative mindset

**Examples:**

✅ **Good:** "HexaHub runs on your infrastructure. Your data never leaves your servers."
❌ **Bad:** "We leverage cutting-edge paradigms to synergize your AI workflow in the cloud."

✅ **Good:** "Self-host with Docker Compose in 5 minutes. No vendor lock-in."
❌ **Bad:** "Our revolutionary platform disrupts the AI workspace industry."

## Keywords (Always Include)

## What to Avoid

- "Synergy", "leverage", "paradigm shift"

**Corporate jargon:**
- "Our proprietary solution"
- "Best-in-class" (without proof)
- "Industry-leading" (generic claim)

**Overpromising:**
- "10× your productivity" (unrealistic)
- "Never write code again" (misleading)
