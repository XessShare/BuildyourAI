# HexaHub Brand Guidelines

## Voice & Tone

**Overall Voice:** Professional but approachable - We speak developer-to-developer

**Tone Principles:**
1. **Direct & Clear:** No fluff, get to the point (developers hate marketing speak)
2. **Technically Accurate:** Assume technical knowledge, don't dumb down
3. **Privacy-Conscious:** Always emphasize data sovereignty and trust
4. **Community-Driven:** Open-source values, collaborative mindset

**Examples:**

✅ **Good:** "HexaHub runs on your infrastructure. Your data never leaves your servers."
❌ **Bad:** "We leverage cutting-edge paradigms to synergize your AI workflow in the cloud."

✅ **Good:** "Self-host with Docker Compose in 5 minutes. No vendor lock-in."
❌ **Bad:** "Our revolutionary platform disrupts the AI workspace industry."

## Keywords (Always Include)

**Primary (Use in every piece of content):**
- Self-hosted / Self-hosting
- Privacy-first / Privacy-focused
- AI-powered / AI workspace

**Secondary (Use frequently):**
- Workflow automation
- Developer productivity
- Open-source / Open-source friendly
- Multi-model AI / No vendor lock-in

**Tertiary (Use contextually):**
- Customizable / Extensible
- Homelab-ready
- Data sovereignty

## What to Avoid

**Buzzwords without substance:**
- "Revolutionary", "game-changing", "disruptive"
- "Synergy", "leverage", "paradigm shift"
- "Cutting-edge" (unless technically accurate)

**Corporate jargon:**
- "Our proprietary solution"
- "Best-in-class" (without proof)
- "Industry-leading" (generic claim)

**Overpromising:**
- "10× your productivity" (unrealistic)
- "Never write code again" (misleading)
- "AI replaces developers" (wrong message)

## Writing Style

- **Sentence length:** 10-20 words (scannable)
- **Paragraph length:** 2-4 sentences (readable)
- **Technical depth:** Assume intermediate+ dev knowledge
- **Code examples:** Always use real, working code (not pseudo-code)
